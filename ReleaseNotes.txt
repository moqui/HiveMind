===========================================================================
Release 1.1.3 - 17 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

HiveMind 1.1.3 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

This release is based on Moqui Framework version 1.6.0 and Mantle Business
Artifacts version 1.2.0 and SimpleScreens version 1.0.0.

While there are a few new screens and improvements to the admin and
PM apps the main changes in this release are quality related. There
are now screen render tests, run on every git push though Travis CI, and
there were various fixes and improvements done while writing these tests.

Many screens (around 4500 lines) were moved to the SimpleScreens project
for more generic reuse. The wiki data model and most of the services were
moved to Moqui Framework (and those dependent on Mantle to Mantle). These
changes help HiveMind focus on being an industry specific suite of
applications while making it easier for other applications to reuse more
generic functionality that was in HiveMind.

The project management application currently has 31 screens and 54 forms.
The admin application currently has 57 screens and 124 forms. HiveMind has
around 7.7k lines of text, mostly in XML files (with a small number of
lines in Groovy, FTL, MarkDown, and CWiki files).

New Features

- Added screen render tests, initially 87 renders
- Added Travis CI configuration and setup automated builds
- Various cleanups and fixes done while screen testing
- Added financial reports based on newer report templates in SimpleScreens
  and services in Mantle, improved existing reports; now includes Balance
  Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, Income Statement, Retained Earnings, and
  Financial Ratios/Metrics
- The wiki entities and services have been moved to moqui and mantle and
  are reused from their new homes
- Various screens useful in other sorts of applications (and reused in
  PopCommerce) have been moved to the new SimpleScreens project; initially
  this includes all Accounting screens and specific Vendor and User screens

===========================================================================

The admin application currently has 57 screens and 121 forms. HiveMind has
around 13k lines of text, mostly in XML files (with a small number of lines
in FTL, MarkDown, and CWiki files).
